## Data Science Experimental Design Project (Work In Progress)

### Project Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Adaptive Learning vs. Static Learning

### Objective:
* To assess the impact of adaptive learning technologies on student performance and engagement compared to traditional static learning methods.

### Methodology:

* Study Design: Implemented both Parallel RCT, Matched-Pairs RCT, Crossover RCT, Withdrawal RCT, Factorial RCT to ensure robust comparisons between groups.

* Participants: Stratified and matched students based on baseline characteristics (GPA, prior performance, etc.) to form treatment (Adaptive Learning) and control (Static Learning) groups.

* Data Collection: Collected metrics including Post-Test Quiz Score, Improvement Score, Study Time, Retention Rate, and Dropout Rate.

### Analysis:
* Conducted Shapiro-Wilk and Leveneâ€™s tests for normality and equal variances.

* Utilized One-Way ANOVA for continuous variables and Chi-Square Test for categorical variables to analyze results.

* Compared means of each metric to evaluate group performance.

### Results:
* Found significant improvements in quiz scores, study time, and retention rates in the adaptive learning group.

* Noted a lower dropout rate in the adaptive learning group compared to the static learning group.

### Conclusion:
The project demonstrated that adaptive learning technologies significantly enhance student engagement and performance, providing valuable insights for educational strategies.
